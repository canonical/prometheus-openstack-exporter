# Security policy


## Reporting a vulnerability
To report a security issue, file a [Private Security Report](https://github.com/canonical/prometheus-openstack-exporter/security/advisories/new)
with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and,
if known, mitigations for the issue.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy)
contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us and what we expect from you.
