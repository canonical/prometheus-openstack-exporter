# There is no API to ask Swift for a list of accounts it knows about.
# Even if there were, Swift (in common case of Keystone auth, at
# least) only knows them by the corresponding tenant ID, which would
# be a less than useful label without post-processing.  The following
# should point to a file containing one line per tenant, with the
# tenant name first, then whitespace, followed by the tenant ID.

# These will typically be read from /etc/swift/swift.conf.  If that
# file cannot be opened, then the Swift library will log an error and
# try to exit.  To run p-s-a-e as a user other than Swift, these
# settings must be set to the same values as Swift itself, and the
# above must point to an always-current readable copy of the rings.
